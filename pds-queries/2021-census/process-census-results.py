# We read the Jotform Google Sheet 3 different ways for 3 different
# purposes:
#
# 1. CSV DictReader with some "simplified" field names.  We do this for several
# chases where using the "simple" field names is good enough to access the
# fields (vs. Jotform's unweildy column/field names).
#
# 2. CSV Dict Reader with Jotform's names.  We do this for accessing some of the
# later fields.  For example: we don't want to have to make up "simple" fields
# for a few hundred fields just to get to the "comments" questions at the very
# end.  So we just let the DictReader use Jotform's column names, even though
# they're unweildy.
#
# 3. XSLX.  We do this because some of the multi-select Jotform fields are
# stored as "A\nB\nC" in the cell values.  But downloading and reading them as
# CSV values loses the \n somewhere along the way.  Reading the data as an XLSX
# preserves the \n so that we can properaly separate out the multi-values by the
# seperator \n's.
