# Do the CC OAuth2 login.
#
# As of June 2023, per
# https://developer.constantcontact.com/api_guide/auth_overview.html,
# there are 4 Constant Contact OAuth2 flows available:
#
# 1. "Authorization Code Flow": this flow requires that the user visit
# a web page, authorize themselves to CC, and then CC redirects their
# browser to a URL of our choice where this app should be waiting to
# receive the CC authorization token (e.g., we'd tell CC to redirect
# to a URI of the form "http://localhost/...").  Frankly, I don't
# really want to setup a (temporary) local web server to receive this
# redirect, so we won't use this flow.
#
# 2. "PKCE Flow": this flow assumes that the app is running in a place
# where we can't store the client secret from
# https://app.constantcontact.com/pages/dma/portal/appList; it
# generates a challenge string that the user has to copy/paste into a
# web browser, and then copy-paste the response back into this app for
# verification.  Seems too much trouble.
#
# 3. "Device flow": this flow queries a CC authorization server to
# receive a unique OTP, and then presents a URL for the user to visit
# in their browser with that OTP.  After they authorize with their CC
# account, then the app is free to continue and request a CC
# authorization code.
#
# *** This is the flow we're using ("device flow") ***
#
# 4. "Implicit flow": this is similar to "authorization code flow" in
# that this app would need to setup a temporary local web server to
# receive the CC authorization code.  A key difference, however, is
# that these authorization codes are not refresh-able.  That's a
# deal-breaker for us.
